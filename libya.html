      <h2>Where is Libya?</h2>
      <p>Libya is a country located in North Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, Tunisia, Algeria, Niger, Chad, Sudan, and Egypt</p>
      <p>Libya used to be an Italian colony until 1951</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "border3"  id = "faq1">
      <h2>How can I get to Libya?</h2>
      <p>First things first, you must apply for an <a href = "https://evisa.gov.ly" class = "a2">evisa</a>. You need a sponsor, such as a tour operator. Then, you can start thinking about reaching Libya.</p>
      <p>Libya is easily reached by air, with its main airport at Tripoli (MJI) being served by flights to Rome, Cairo, Tunis, Sfax, and Istanbul</p>
      <p>Visiting Libya by boat is only possible via the Kevalay Queen, from Istanbul to Tripoli</p>
      <p>The only feasible entry by land is from Tunisia, at the Dehiba - Wazin crossing. The Ras Ajdir crossing is unstable. It is theoretically possible to enter Libya from Egypt at Sallum or Siwa, but since East Libya is under a different government, they will reject your evisa. All crossings with other countries are either closed or not open to foreigners, and they all are extremely unsafe.</p>
