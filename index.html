      <h2>Where is Algeria?</h2>
      <p>Algeria is a country located in North Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Western Sahara, and Niger</p>
      <p>Algeria is the largest country in Africa, after the breakup of Sudan in 2011.</p>

      <h2>How can I get to Algeria?</h2>
      <p>First things first, you must apply for a visa at your local Algerian embassy. Then, you can start thinking about reaching Algeria.</p>
      <p>Algeria is easily reached by air, with its main airport at Algiers being served by frequent flights to Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, with flights also to Johannesburg, Montreal, Kuala Lumpur, and Beijing.</p>
      <p>Visiting Algeria by boat may include a long ride; current routes are Valencia to Mostaganem by <a href = "https://balearia.com/en" class = "a2">Balearia Lines</a>, Almeria to Ghazaouet and Oran by <a href = "https://transmediterranea.es/en" class = "a2">Transmediterranea</a>, and various irregular ferries from Marseille and Sete to Skikda, Algiers, and Bejaia by <a href = "https://corsicalinea.com/eng" class = "a2">Corisca Linea</a>.</p>
      <p>The only feasible entry by land is from Tunisia, at the Tabarka - El Kala crossing and at the Naftah - Taleb Larbi crossing. Though there are reports of crossings from Tindouf to Mauritania, it is highly unadvised due to security issues in the area. All crossings with Morocco, Western Sahara, Mali, Niger, and Libya are either closed or controlled by rebel groups, and the security in border areas is perenially unstable.</p>
